# Helper Scripts to Run CHOCO-SGD with overparameterized models

* `example.sh` contains base execution script with editable hidden units width and algorithm.
* All Jupyter notebooks plot logs found in the `data/` directory
* `command_log.txt` contains experiment tracking information in plaintext
* Find all CHOCO-SGD algorithms in `pcode/optim` directory including MPI implementation of DSGD
* `test_cif_10_1.py` and `test_cifar.py` are testing scripts. Please use `python3 test_cifar.py -h` for command-line options
